# Course project

## What will the application do?
This application will be a recreation of the traditional minesweeper with some added features. 
The application should be able to:
- Generate a bomb layout upon first click
- Save scores associated with usernames
- Be able to generate an average score for a player, based on saved scores
- Be able to create customizable layouts (customized grid size, number of bombs, etc)


In short, you should be able to play minesweeper on it and 
save and view your times.

## Who will use it?
I imagine that it would be used by people who like playing puzzle games or perhaps just enjoy playing minesweeper. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This was inspired by a game that I like to play called Demoncrawl.
Demoncrawl is a rogue-like minesweeper where you solve boards in succession. 
I enjoy playing games and my original idea probably wasn't feasible to accomplish. 

## User stories
As a user, I want to be able to:
- be able to flag a bomb.
- be able to see my best times.
- be able to use the middle click function *that for some reason isn't always implemented*.
- save my scores.
- be able to end the game on fail. 
- be able to add cells to my grid to change the dimensions
- be able to add my times to scores
- be able to stop and save my minesweeper game 
- be able to resume my last minesweeper game
